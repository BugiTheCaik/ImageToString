# ImageToString
An simple algorithm given any image generates a sequence of points that a string woven around the points gives a close approximation of the original image in real life.

The code was written after watching [GoldPlatedGoofs video](https://youtu.be/-S_l8GGxOhU) on the topic, and I severely needed something to do through the holiday season.

Feedback is greatly appreciated! This is my first attempt at GitHub and non-hardware oriented programming in over a year, and I'd love to find a more elegant solution.
