# ImageToString
An simple algorithm given any image generates a sequence of points that a string woven around the points gives a close approximation of the original image in real life.

# Usage
The program is a simple python script. All information is inside the file.

To get started ensure you have Numpy and Python sci-kit image (Skimage) installed.
Then enter the path to your desired image in the variable ImagePath and run the file.

I suggest you tinker around with the configuration, as better results can often be achieved.

I had previously made a far too complicated script that barely worked. This is one far simpler, but if there are any additional features you'd need, you'll have an easier time making this script suit your needs.

# Example
![Milton 500-> 3500 lines](Examples/milton.png?raw=true)

<img src="Examples/line_4000jesus1.png?raw=true" width="350"><img src="Examples/line5000tommyc.png?raw=true" width="350">

# Credit

The code was written after watching [GoldPlatedGoofs video](https://youtu.be/-S_l8GGxOhU) on the topic, and I severely needed something to do through the holiday season. Highly recommended material as it kept me (somewhat) focused on the task.

Feedback is greatly appreciated! This is my first attempt at GitHub and non-hardware oriented programming in over a year, and I'd love to find a more elegant solution.
